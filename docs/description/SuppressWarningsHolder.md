<div>

Maintains a set of check suppressions from `@SuppressWarnings`
annotations. It allows to prevent Checkstyle from reporting violations
from parts of code that were annotated with `@SuppressWarnings` and
using name of the check to be excluded. It is possible to suppress all
the checkstyle warnings with the argument `"all"`. You can also use a
`checkstyle:` prefix to prevent compiler from processing these
annotations. You can also define aliases for check names that need to be
suppressed.
