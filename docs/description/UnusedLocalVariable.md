<div>

Checks that a local variable is declared and/or assigned, but not used.
Doesn't support [pattern variables
yet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.30).
Doesn't check [array
components](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.3)
as array components are classified as different kind of variables by
[JLS](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/index.html).
