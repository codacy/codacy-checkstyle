Checks that classes and records which define a covariant `equals()`
method also override method `equals(Object)`.

</div>

Covariant `equals()` - method that is similar to `equals(Object)`, but
with a covariant parameter type (any subtype of Object).

**Notice**: the enums are also checked, even though they cannot override
`equals(Object)`. The reason is to point out that implementing
`equals()` in enums is considered an awful practice: it may cause having
two different enum values that are equal using covariant enum method,
and not equal when compared normally.

Inspired by [Finding Bugs is Easy, chapter '4.5 Bad Covariant Definition
of Equals (Eq)'](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~daveho/pubs/oopsla2004.pdf):

Java classes and records may override the `equals(Object)` method to
define a predicate for object equality. This method is used by many of
the Java runtime library classes; for example, to implement generic
containers.

Programmers sometimes mistakenly use the type of their class `Foo` as
the type of the parameter to `equals()`:

    public boolean equals(Foo obj) {...}
            

This covariant version of `equals()` does not override the version in
the `Object` class, and it may lead to unexpected behavior at runtime,
especially if the class is used with one of the standard collection
classes which expect that the standard `equals(Object)` method is
overridden.

This kind of bug is not obvious because it looks correct, and in
circumstances where the class is accessed through the references of the
class type (rather than a supertype), it will work correctly. However,
the first time it is used in a container, the behavior might be
mysterious. For these reasons, this type of bug can elude testing and
code inspections.
