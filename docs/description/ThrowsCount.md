<div>

Restricts throws statements to a specified count. Methods with
"Override" or "java.lang.Override" annotation are skipped from
validation as current class cannot change signature of these methods.

Rationale: Exceptions form part of a method's interface. Declaring a
method to throw too many differently rooted exceptions makes exception
handling onerous and leads to poor programming practices such as writing
code like `catch(Exception ex)`. 4 is the empirical value which is based
on reports that we had for the ThrowsCountCheck over big projects such
as OpenJDK. This check also forces developers to put exceptions into a
hierarchy such that in the simplest case, only one type of exception
need be checked for by a caller but any subclasses can be caught
specifically if necessary. For more information on rules for the
exceptions and their issues, see Effective Java: Programming Language
Guide Second Edition by Joshua Bloch pages 264-273.

**ignorePrivateMethods** - allows to skip private methods as they do not
cause problems for other classes.
