<div>

Restricts the number of boolean operators (`&&`, `||`, `&`, `|` and `^`)
in an expression.

</div>

Rationale: Too many conditions leads to code that is difficult to read
and hence debug and maintain.

Note that the operators `&` and `|` are not only integer bitwise
operators, they are also the [non-shortcut
versions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.22.2)
of the boolean operators `&&` and `||`.

Note that `&`, `|` and `^` are not checked if they are part of
constructor or method call because they can be applied to non-boolean
variables and Checkstyle does not know types of methods from different
classes.
