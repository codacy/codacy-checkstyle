Controls what can be imported in each package and file. Useful for
ensuring that application layering rules are not violated, especially on
large projects.

You can control imports based on the a package name or based on the file
name. When controlling packages, all files and sub-packages in the
declared package will be controlled by this check. To specify
differences between a main package and a sub-package, you must define
the sub-package inside the main package. When controlling file, only the
file name is considered and only files processed by
[TreeWalker](https://checkstyle.org/config.html#TreeWalker). The file's
extension is ignored.

Short description of the behaviour:

-   Check starts checking from the longest matching subpackage (later
    'current subpackage') or the first file name match described inside
    import control file to package defined in class file.
    -   The longest matching subpackage is found by starting with the
        root package and examining if the any of the sub-packages or
        file definitions match the current class' package or file name.
    -   If a file name is matched first, that is considered the longest
        match and becomes the current file/subpackage.
    -   If another subpackage is matched, then it's subpackages and file
        names are examined for the next longest match and the process
        repeats recursively.
    -   If no subpackages or file names are matched, the current
        subpackage is then used.
-   Order of rules in the same subpackage/root are defined by the order
    of declaration in the XML file, which is from top (first) to bottom
    (last).
-   If there is matching allow/disallow rule inside the current
    file/subpackage then the Check returns the first "allowed" or
    "disallowed" message.
-   If there is no matching allow/disallow rule inside the current
    file/subpackage then it continues checking in the parent subpackage.
-   If there is no matching allow/disallow rule in any of the
    files/subpackages, including the root level (import-control), then
    the import is disallowed by default.

The DTD for a import control XML document is at
[https://checkstyle.org/dtds/import\_control\_1\_4.dtd](/dtds/import_control_1_4.dtd).
It contains documentation on each of the elements and attributes.

The check validates a XML document when it loads the document. To
validate against the above DTD, include the following document type
declaration in your XML document:

    <!DOCTYPE import-control PUBLIC
        "-//Checkstyle//DTD ImportControl Configuration 1.4//EN"
        "https://checkstyle.org/dtds/import_control_1_4.dtd">
