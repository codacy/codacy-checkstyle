Checks that the whitespace around the Generic tokens (angle brackets)
"&lt;" and "&gt;" are correct to the *typical* convention. The
convention is not configurable.

Left angle bracket ("&lt;"):

-   should be preceded with whitespace only in generic methods
    definitions.
-   should not be preceded with whitespace when it is precede method
    name or constructor.
-   should not be preceded with whitespace when following type name.
-   should not be followed with whitespace in all cases.

Right angle bracket ("&gt;"):

-   should not be preceded with whitespace in all cases.
-   should be followed with whitespace in almost all cases, except
    diamond operators and when preceding method name or constructor.
