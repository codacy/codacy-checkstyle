<div>

Checks the padding between the identifier of a method definition,
constructor definition, method call, constructor invocation, record, or
record pattern; and the left parenthesis of the parameter list. That is,
if the identifier and left parenthesis are on the same line, checks
whether a space is required immediately after the identifier or such a
space is forbidden. If they are not on the same line, reports a
violation, unless configured to allow line breaks. To allow linebreaks
after the identifier, set property `allowLineBreaks` to ` true`.
