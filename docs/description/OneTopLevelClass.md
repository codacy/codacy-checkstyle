Checks that each top-level class, interface, enum or annotation resides
in a source file of its own. Official description of a 'top-level' term:
[7.6. Top Level Type
Declarations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.6).
If file doesn't contain public class, interface, enum or annotation,
top-level type is the first type in file.
