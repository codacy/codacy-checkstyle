Restrict using [Unicode
escapes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.3)
(such as \\u221e). It is possible to allow using escapes for
[non-printable, control
characters](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Control_characters).
Also, this check can be configured to allow using escapes if trail
comment is present. By the option it is possible to allow using escapes
if literal contains only them.
