Since Checkstyle 3.0

Checks the policy on the padding of parentheses; i.e. whether a space is required after a left parenthesis and before a right parenthesis, or such spaces are forbidden. No check occurs at the right parenthesis after an empty for iterator, at the left parenthesis before an empty for initialization, or at the right parenthesis of a try-with-resources resource specification where the last resource variable has a trailing semi-colon. Use Check EmptyForIteratorPad to validate empty for iterators and EmptyForInitializerPad to validate empty for initializers. Typecasts are also not checked, as there is TypecastParenPad to validate them.
