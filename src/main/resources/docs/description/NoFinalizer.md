Checks that there is no method `finalize` with zero parameters.

See
[Object.finalize()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#finalize\(\))

Rationale: Finalizers are unpredictable, often dangerous, and generally
unnecessary. Their use can cause erratic behavior, poor performance, and
portability problems. For more information for the finalize method and
its issues, see Effective Java: Programming Language Guide Third Edition
by Joshua Bloch, ยง8.
