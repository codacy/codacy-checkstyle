Checks that certain exception types do not appear in a `catch` statement.

Rationale: catching `java.lang.Exception`, `java.lang.Error` or `java.lang.RuntimeException` is almost never acceptable. Novice developers often simply catch Exception in an attempt to handle multiple exception classes. This unfortunately leads to code that inadvertently catches `NullPointerException`, `OutOfMemoryError`, etc.
