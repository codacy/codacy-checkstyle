Checks that each top-level class, interface or enum resides in a source
file of its own. Official description of a \'top-level\' term: [7.6. Top
Level Type
Declarations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.6).
If file doesn\'t contains public class, enum or interface, top-level
type is the first type in file.
