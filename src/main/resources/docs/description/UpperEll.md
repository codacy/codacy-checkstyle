Since Checkstyle 3.0

Checks that long constants are defined with an upper ell. That is `' L'`
and not `'l'`. This is in accordance with the Java Language
Specification, [Section
3.10.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.10.1).

The lower-case ell `'l'` looks a lot like `1`.
