Ensures that a class has a package declaration, and (optionally) whether
the package name matches the directory name for the source file.

Packages provide logical namespace to classes and should be stored in
the form of directory levels to provide physical grouping to your
classes. These directories are added to the classpath so that your
classes are visible to JVM when it runs the code.
