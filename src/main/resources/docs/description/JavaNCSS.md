Since Checkstyle 3.5

Determines complexity of methods, classes and files by
counting the Non Commenting Source Statements (NCSS). This
check adheres to the [specification](http://www.kclee.de/clemens/java/javancss/#specification) for the
[JavaNCSS-Tool](http://www.kclee.de/clemens/java/javancss/)
written by **Chr. Clemens Lee** .  
Roughly said the NCSS metric is calculated by
counting the source lines which are not comments, (nearly)
equivalent to counting the semicolons and opening curly
braces.  
The NCSS for a class is summarized from the NCSS
of all its methods, the NCSS of its nested classes and the
number of member variable declarations.  
The NCSS for a
file is summarized from the ncss of all its top level classes,
the number of imports and the package declaration.

Rationale: Too large methods and classes are hard to read and
costly to maintain. A large NCSS number often means that a
method or class has too many responsibilities and/or
functionalities which should be decomposed into smaller units.
