Checks that there is no whitespace before a token. More specifically, it
checks that it is not preceded with whitespace, or (if linebreaks are
allowed) all characters on the line before are whitespace. To allow
linebreaks before a token, set property `allowLineBreaks` to `true`. No
check occurs before semi-colons in empty for loop initializers or
conditions.
