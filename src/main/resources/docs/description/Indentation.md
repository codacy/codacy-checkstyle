Since Checkstyle 3.1

Checks correct indentation of Java code.

The idea behind this is that while pretty printers are
sometimes convenient for bulk reformats of legacy code, they often
either aren't configurable enough or just can't anticipate how
format should be done. Sometimes this is personal preference, other
times it is practical experience. In any case, this check should
just ensure that a minimal set of indentation rules is followed.
