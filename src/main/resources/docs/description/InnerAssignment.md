Checks for assignments in subexpressions, such as in `String s =
Integer.toString(i = 2);`.

Rationale: With the exception of `for` iterators and assignment in
`while` idiom, all assignments should occur in their own top-level
statement to increase readability. With inner assignments like the one
given above, it is difficult to see all places where a variable is set.

Note: Check allows usage of the popular assignment in `while` idiom:

``` 
String line;
while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
  // process the line
}
        
```

Assignment inside a condition is not a problem here, as the assignment
is surrounded by an extra pair of parentheses. The comparison is `!=
null` and there is no chance that intention was to write `line ==
reader.readLine()`.
