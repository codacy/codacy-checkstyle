Checks for missing Javadoc comments in package-info.java files.

Rationale: description and other related documentation for a package can
be written up in the package-info.java file and it gets used in the
production of the Javadocs. See
[link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#packagecomment)
for more info.
