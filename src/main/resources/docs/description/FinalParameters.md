Check that parameters for methods, constructors, catch and for-each
blocks are final. Interface, abstract, and native methods are not
checked: the final keyword does not make sense for interface, abstract,
and native method parameters as there is no code that could modify the
parameter.

Rationale: Changing the value of parameters during the execution of the
method\'s algorithm can be confusing and should be avoided. A great way
to let the Java compiler prevent this coding style is to declare
parameters final.
