Checks that Javadocs are located at the correct position. As specified at [ Documentation Comment Specification for the Standard Doclet][Documentation Comment Specification for the Standard Doclet], Javadocs are recognized only when placed immediately before module, package, class, interface, constructor, method, or field declarations. Any other position, like in the body of a method, will be ignored by the javadoc tool and is considered invalid by this check.
