Checks for implicit modifiers on interface members and nested types.

This check is effectively the opposite of
[RedundantModifier](https://checkstyle.org/config_modifier.html#RedundantModifier).
It checks the modifiers on interface members, ensuring that certain
modifiers are explicitly specified even though they are actually redundant.

Methods in interfaces are `public` by default, however from Java 9
they can also be `private`. This check provides the ability to enforce
that `public` is explicitly coded and not implicitly added by the compiler.

From Java 8, there are three types of methods in interfaces - static methods
marked with `static`, default methods marked with `default` and
abstract methods which do not have to be marked with anything.
From Java 9, there are also private methods marked with `private`.
This check provides the ability to enforce that `abstract` is explicitly
coded and not implicitly added by the compiler.

Fields in interfaces are always `public static final` and as such the
compiler does not require these modifiers. This check provides the ability to
enforce that these modifiers are explicitly coded and not implicitly added by
the compiler.

Nested types within an interface are always `public static` and as such the
compiler does not require the `public static` modifiers. This check provides
the ability to enforce that the `public` and `static` modifiers
are explicitly coded and not implicitly added by the compiler.


    public interface AddressFactory {
      // check enforces code contains "public static final"
      public static final String UNKNOWN = "Unknown";

      String OTHER = "Other";  // violation

      // check enforces code contains "public" or "private"
      public static AddressFactory instance();

      // check enforces code contains "public abstract"
      public abstract Address createAddress(String addressLine, String city);

      List<Address> findAddresses(String city);  // violation

      // check enforces default methods are explicitly declared "public"
      public default Address createAddress(String city) {
        return createAddress(UNKNOWN, city);
      }

      default Address createOtherAddress() {  // violation
        return createAddress(OTHER, OTHER);
      }
    }
            
Rationale for this check:
Methods, fields and nested types are treated differently depending on whether
they are part of an interface or part of a class. For example, by default methods
are package-scoped on classes, but public in interfaces. However, from Java 8 onwards,
interfaces have changed to be much more like abstract classes.
Interfaces now have static and instance methods with code. Developers should not have
to remember which modifiers are required and which are implied.
This check allows the simpler alternative approach to be adopted where the
implied modifiers must always be coded explicitly.
